[GNN-min-example](https://github.com/guillaumejaume/gnn-min-example)

A simple implementation of a Graph Neural Network for graph classification tasks. The code is currently set to operate on a  directed graph with node features. The graphs can also have edge weights. This code is leveraging the `DGL` dataloader. A custom dataloader can easlily be implemented to adapt to any custom graph (e.g., with node labels).
